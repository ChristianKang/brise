Contents
===
This software is a collection of data packages used by [Rime](http://rime.im)
to support various Chinese input methods, including those based on modern
dialects or historical diasystems of the Chinese language.

A **Rime input schema** describes the behaviors of a specific input method
in Rime's DSL. It consists of a configuration file named `*.schema.yaml` where
`*` is schema ID, and an optional **Rime dictionary** file named `*.dict.yaml`.

A package may contain one or several interrelated input schemata and their
affiliated Rime dictionaries.

Usage
===

To prepare your Rime configuration for [Squirrel](https://github.com/rime/squirrel),
[Weasel](https://github.com/rime/weasel) or
[ibus-rime](https://github.com/rime/ibus-rime), you can get started by running

```sh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/v13uY | bash
```

This runs the `rime-install` script to download preset packages and install
source files to Rime user directory. (yet it doesn't enable new schemas for you)

Alternatively, you can specify a configuration among `:preset`, `:extra` and
`:all` (note the colon):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://git.io/v13uY | bash -s -- :preset
```

This is equivalent to cloning this repo and running `rime-install`:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/rime/brise.git
cd brise
bash rime-install :preset
```

You can then add packages from great Rime developers on GitHub by specifying a
list of package names or `user/repo`:

```sh
bash rime-install middle-chinese lotem/rime-zhung acevery/rime-zhengma
```

Lastly, it's also possible to install other author's Rime configuration from a
`*-packages.conf` file hosted on GitHub. For example, navigate to this page

https://github.com/lotem/rime-forge/blob/master/lotem-packages.conf

click the "Raw" button on the top-right corner of source code listing, and
copy the URL to the raw file into the command

```sh
bash rime-install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lotem/rime-forge/master/lotem-packages.conf
```

For third-party Rime distributions, specify the path to Rime user directory in
the command line:

```sh
rime_dir=$HOME/.config/fcitx/rime bash rime-install
```

To update la brise itself, run

```sh
bash rime-install self-update
```

Install
===

The Makefile builds and installs Rime data as a binary package on Unix systems.

Build dependencies
---

- git
- librime>=1.3 (for `rime_deployer`)

Run-time dependencies
---

  - librime>=1.3
  - opencc>=1.0.2

Build and install
---

The default make target uses `git` command line to download the latest packages
from GitHub.

```sh
make
sudo make install
```

You can optionally build YAML files to binaries by setting the shell variable
`BRISE_BUILD_BINARIES`. To build preset packages, do

```sh
BRISE_BUILD_BINARIES=yes make preset
```
